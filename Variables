type variableName = value; //syntax for creating a variable 
// type is a C# type like int and string 
// variableName is the name of the variable (like x or name)
// the = is used to assign value to the variable

CREATE A  VARIABLE CALLED NAME OF TYPE string AND ASSIGN IT THE VALUE "John":
string name = "John";
Console.Writeline(name);

CREATE A VARIABLE THAT SHOULD STORE A NUMBER
int myNum = 15;
Console.Writeline(myNum);

DECLARE A VARIABLE WITHOUT ASSIGNING THE VALUE AND ASSIGNING IT LATER ON
int myNum;
myNum = 15;
Console.Writeline(myNum);

ASSIGN A NEW VALUE TO AN EXISTING VARAIBLE OVERWRITING THE PREV. VALUE
int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20; // the switch is here
Console.Writeline(myNum);
// Writeline() method is used to display variable values to the console window

HOW TO DECLARE VARIABLES OF OTHER TYPES
int myNum = 5;
double myDoubleNum = 5.99D;
char myLetter = 'D';
bool MyBool = true;
string myText = "Hello";

COMBINE BOTH TEXT AND VARIABLE USE THE + CHARACTRER:
string name = "John";
Console.Writeline("Hello " + name);


YOU CAN USE THE + CHARACTER TO ADD A VARIABLE TO ANOTHER VARIABLE:
string firstName = "John ";
string lastName = 'Doe";
string fullName = firstName + lastName;
Console.Writeline(fullName);

Multiple Variables:
DECLARE MORE THAN 1 VARIABLE OF THE SAME TYPE USING COMMA SEPARATED LIST
int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50; 
Console.WriteLine(x + y = z);

ASSIGN THE SAME VALUE TO MULIPLE VARIABLES IN 1 LINE 
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
Console.Writeline(x + y + z);

IDENTIFIERS 
// C# varaibles must be identified with unique names (identifiers) they can be whatever you want but recommeneded to be descriptive 
//rules for naming variables include:
  - Names can contain letters, digits, and the underscore character (_)
  - Names must begin with a letter 
  - Names should start w/ a lowercase letter and it can't contain whitespace
  - Names are case sensitive!!!
  - There are reserved words like int and double
